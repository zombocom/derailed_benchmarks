  # The core extension we use to measure require time of all requires
  # When a file is required we create a tree node with its file name.
  # We then push it onto a stack, this is because requiring a file can
  # require other files before it is finished.
  #
  # When a child file is required, a tree node is created and the child file
  # is pushed onto the parents tree. We then repeat the process as child
  # files may require additional files.
  #
  # When a require returns we remove it from the require stack so we don't
  # accidentally push additional children nodes to it. We then store the
  # memory cost of the require in the tree node.
